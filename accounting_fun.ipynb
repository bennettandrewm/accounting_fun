    "This project is currently under construction. But when complete, it will alleviate the hastle of managing my expenses from a spreadsheet every month. The idea is to maintain my own database of expenses, and then have a machine learning model categorize those expenses. Once we've classified it, we can develop dashboards that will resonate with everyone.\n",
